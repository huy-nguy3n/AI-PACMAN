A modified version of the Pacman educational project from the [Berkeley AI Lab](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). This repository includes three main projects:
 - **Search in Pac-Man:** In this project, Pac-Man agent will find paths through their maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. General search algorithms are built and applied to different Pac-Man scenarios.
 - **Multi-Agent Pac-Man:** In this project, agents are designed for the classic version of Pac-Man, including ghosts. Minimax and expectimax search are implemented and trying evaluation function design.
 - **Reinforcement Learning:** In this project, value iteration and q-learning are implemented. Agents are first tested on Gridworld (from class), then apply to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pac-Man.

For detailed information, commands, and project-specific instructions, please refer to the individual README.md files in each project folder. The necessary details for running and understanding each project can be found within their respective directories.

### Acknowledgements

This project has been built up from the work of many people.
Here are just a few that we know about:
 - The Berkley AI Lab for starting this project. Primarily John Denero and Dan Klein.
 - Barak Michener for providing the original graphics and debugging help.
 - Ed Karuna for providing the original graphics and debugging help.
 - Jeremy Cowles for implementing an initial tournament infrastructure.
 - LiveWires for providing some code from a Pacman implementation (used / modified with permission).
 - The LINQS lab from UCSC.
 - Graduates of the CMPS 140 class who have helped pave the way for future classes (their identities are immortalized in the git history).
